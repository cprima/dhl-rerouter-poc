# DHL Rerouter Automation Project â€” Project Report

## Overview
This project automates DHL package rerouting by monitoring emails for tracking codes, checking user calendar for absence periods, and executing reroutes via the DHL website when the user is away. It is designed for extensibility, maintainability, and robust automation, with a strong focus on testability and observability.

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.13+
- Selenium (browser automation)
- IMAP (email integration)
- uv (Python package manager)
- Pydantic (data modeling)
- Pytest (testing)
- YAML (configuration)

## Key Features & Architecture
- **Unified Workflow Data Model:**
  - All shipment and workflow state is handled via a Pydantic-based model (`ShipmentLifecycle` and related classes), ensuring type safety, validation, and easy expansion for new carriers or workflow steps.
- **Model-Driven Workflow:**
  - Main orchestration code (`main.py`) is now model-driven, reducing ad hoc logic and improving clarity, maintainability, and testability.
- **Pluggable, Future-Proof Design:**
  - The architecture supports future multi-carrier and multi-backend expansion, with clear separation between workflow, data model, and external integrations.
- **Environment-Driven Debug Logging:**
  - Opt-in, structured model state logging at INFO level, controlled by the `DEBUG_MODEL` environment variable, enables deep introspection for debugging and traceability without overwhelming log noise.
- **Configuration & Security:**
  - All sensitive credentials and configuration are handled via environment variables and YAML files, never hardcoded.
- **Comprehensive Testing:**
  - Pytest-based suite covers unit and integration tests for the data model and workflow logic.

## Recent Improvements
- Introduced a unified workflow data model with Pydantic for the entire shipment lifecycle.
- Refactored main workflow to use the model at every stage, improving data consistency and enabling richer validation.
- Added a dedicated logging utility for model state debugging, with opt-in control via `.env` or environment.
- Repo-wide suppression of noisy third-party deprecation warnings.
- Improved backlog and documentation for future-proofing and maintainability.

## Backlog & Recommendations
- Expand end-to-end and edge-case test coverage.
- Further modularize carrier and backend logic for true pluggability.
- Enhance observability (workflow/run IDs, structured logs, metrics).
- Improve developer documentation and onboarding materials.
- Set up CI/CD for automated testing and linting.

## Security & Best Practices
- Credentials and secrets are managed via `.env` and not committed.
- Logging and debug output are opt-in and never expose sensitive information by default.
- Follows PEP8, type hints, and modular, explicit code design.
